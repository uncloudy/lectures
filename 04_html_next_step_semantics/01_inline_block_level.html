    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a> of the order Pholidota
        (from Ancient Greek, "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has
        three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four
        species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species
        each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30
        to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also
        known.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they
        are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or
        burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
        consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long
        tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and
        produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
        years.
    </p>
    <h2>Poaching</h2>
    <p>
        Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are
        used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of their
        natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
        January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis,
        M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically endangered,
        three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
        listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia
        temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species
        of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
