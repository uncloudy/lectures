    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a> of the order Pholidota
      (from Ancient Greek, "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has
      three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four
      species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species
      each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30
      to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also
      known.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they
      are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or
      burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
      consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long
      tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and
      produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
      years.
    </p>
    <h2>Poaching</h2>
    <p>
      Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are
      used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of their
      natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
      January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis,
      M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically endangered,
      three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
      listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia
      temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species
      of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
